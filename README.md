# MyFirstJade

Multi-agent system finds average of agents values.

I used archetype from http://ideaheap.com/2015/05/jade-setup-for-beginners.

Before working do the following:
 - set project SDK to 1.8
 - build project
 
To start multi-agent system do the following:
 - run maven configurations "Main" then "Agents"
 - watch the output to the console

In case of failure run "mvn clean" command first.

You can redefine agents in "resource/jade-agent-container.properties".
Each one is set by its value and list of linked agents.
