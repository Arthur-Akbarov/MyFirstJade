# MyFirstJade

Multi-agent system which finds average of agents values.<br>
Archetype is taken from http://ideaheap.com/2015/05/jade-setup-for-beginners<br>

Before working add maven and build project.

To start multi-agent system do the following:
 - run profile "Main"
 - run profile "Agents"
 - watch Agents console output
 
You can redefine agents in "resource/jade-agent-container.properties".<br>
Each one is set by its value and list of linked agents.
