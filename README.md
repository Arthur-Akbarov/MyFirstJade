# MyFirstJade

Multi-agent system finds average of agents values.

Used archetype from http://ideaheap.com/2015/05/jade-setup-for-beginners.

Run maven configurations "Main" then "Agents" to start.
In case of failure run "mvn clean" command first.

Agents are set in "resource/jade-agent-container.properties"
by value and adjacency list of linked agents.
